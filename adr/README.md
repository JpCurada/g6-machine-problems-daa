# Algorithm Activity Documentation Report

---

## I. Assigned Algorithm

**A. Name of Algorithm:**  
*(e.g., Bubble Sort, Knapsack, TSP, etc.)*

**B. Pseudocode:**  
```plaintext
(Paste or write the pseudocode here, formatted for clarity)
```

**C. Brief Description:**  
*(Write 2â€“3 sentences describing what the algorithm does and its main purpose.)*

---

## II. Python Implementation

**A. Function Code:**  
```python
(Paste your Python function here. Ensure it includes a docstring that explains all parameters and return values.)
```

**B. Docstring Example:**  
```python
def example_algo(param1, param2):
    \"\"\"
    Brief description of what the function does.

    Args:
        param1 (type): Description of param1.
        param2 (type): Description of param2.

    Returns:
        return_type: Description of the return value(s).
    \"\"\"
    # function body
```

## III. Simulation / Step-by-Step Example

**A. Sample Input:**  
*(Show a sample input as a user would provide it.)*

**B. Step-by-Step Process:**  
1. *(Describe what happens at each step of the algorithm with the sample input. Use bullet points or a numbered list.)*
2. *(Show intermediate states if relevant, e.g., list after each pass in sorting.)*

**C. Final Output:**  
*(Show the final output/result for the sample input.)*

---

## IV. Discussion

**A. Implementation Logic:**  
*(Discuss the main logic behind your implementation. Why did you structure it this way? What were the key decisions?)*

**B. References:**  
*(List any references, textbooks, or online resources you used.)*

**C. Possible Improvements / Future Work:**  
*(Discuss any limitations, possible optimizations, or features you would add in the future.)*

---

**Tips:**
- Use clear formatting for code and pseudocode.
- Keep explanations concise but thorough.
- Use diagrams or tables if they help clarify the process.
