\section{Introduction}
\subsection*{Definition and Concept of Brute Force Algorithms}
Brute force algorithms represent one of the most fundamental problem-solving strategies in computer science. These algorithms solve problems by examining all possible solution candidates systematically and exhaustively until the correct solution is found. The approach derives its name from the straightforward, direct manner in which it tackles problemsâ€”similar to using "brute force" or raw computational power rather than sophisticated techniques.
At its core, a brute force algorithm works by:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Generating all possible solution candidates
    \item Testing each candidate against the problem requirements
    \item Selecting the first (or best) candidate that satisfies the requirements
\end{itemize}
While conceptually simple, brute force algorithms serve as a baseline for understanding algorithmic efficiency and establish the foundation for more complex optimization techniques.
    
\subsection*{Significance and Applications}
Despite their simplicity, brute force algorithms hold significant importance for several reasons:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Guaranteed Correctness:} Brute force algorithms are guaranteed to find the optimal solution if it exists, as they explore the entire solution space.
    \item \textbf{Benchmark for Comparison:} They establish a baseline against which more sophisticated algorithms can be measured and evaluated.
    \item \textbf{Educational Value:} Understanding brute force approaches provides insight into the fundamental nature of computational problems and their inherent complexity.
    \item \textbf{Practical Applications:} For problems with small input sizes or where optimal solutions are crucial, brute force algorithms may be appropriate and effective.
    \item \textbf{Foundation for Advanced Techniques:} Many advanced algorithmic strategies build upon or improve brute force approaches.
\end{itemize}

In practical scenarios, brute force algorithms find applications in various domains, including cryptography (for exhaustive key searches), bioinformatics (for sequence matching), and optimization problems when the input size is manageably small.

\section{Brute Force Algorithms}

\subsection{Bubble Sort}
\subsubsection*{Brief Description}
Bubble Sort is the simplest sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order. This algorithm is not suitable for large data sets as its average and worst-case time complexity are quite high.
\subsubsection*{Pseudocode}
\begin{lstlisting}
Start
    - Accept array(arrInput) and boolean(boolAscending) to check if it will be 
    sorted ascending or descending.
    - initialize the size of the array(intSize)
    - initialize the variable to store the steps (arrSteps)
    - initialize the variable for the result of the sorting by first copying the 
    array that is passed first (arrResult)
    -If boolAscending is true
        - for i is less than size of the array
            set boolSwapped to false
                - for j is less than the size of array minus i
                    - if the value of element at index[j] is greater than the 
                    element at inde[j+1]
                        swap the elements of index[j] and index[j+1]
                        set boolSwapped to true
                - if boolSwapped is true
                    append a copy of arrayResult to arrSteps
                - if boolSwapped is false
                    exit the loop
    - else if boolAscending is false
        proceed to do the same process but it will swap if the value of element 
        at index[j] is less than that of element at index[j+1]
    -return variables arrResult, arrSteps
End

    \item Fourth iteration complete
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{Final Output}
    Sorted List: [5, 9, 12, 37, 98]

\subsection*{Discussion}
\subsubsection*{Implementation Logic}
The function takes input from the user then it also takes a boolean to check if it should be ascending or descending. The function used and conditional statement to check if it should be ascending or descending. In sorting the list, the function uses a nested for loop. The outer loop keeps track of how many passes while the inner loop is the one that compares and swap the adjacent elements. The rightmost value is always the first to be sorted that is why each iteration of the outerloop subtracts in the range of the inner loop. The process repeats until the list is sorted.



%SELECTION SORT
\subsection{Selection Sort}
\subsubsection*{Brief Description}
Selection Sort is a comparison-based sorting algorithm that divides the input list into two parts: a sorted sublist and an unsorted sublist. It repeatedly selects the minimum (or maximum) element from the unsorted portion and places it in its correct position. This implementation supports both ascending and descending order and works with numbers or strings. It also records each significant step of the sorting process for visualization or analysis.
\subsubsection*{Pseudocode}

FUNCTION fnSelectionSort(arrInput, boolAscending = True):
    SET intSize = length of arrInput
    SET arrResult = copy of arrInput
    SET arrSteps = empty list

    FOR i FROM 0 TO intSize - 1:
        SET intMinIndex = i

        FOR j FROM i+1 TO intSize - 1:
            SET varCurrent = lower(arrResult[j]) IF element is string ELSE 
            arrResult[j]
            SET varMin = lower(arrResult[intMinIndex]) IF element is string ELSE 
            arrResult[intMinIndex]

            IF boolAscending AND varCurrent < varMin:
                SET intMinIndex = j
            ELSE IF NOT boolAscending AND varCurrent > varMin:
                SET intMinIndex = j

        IF intMinIndex != i:
            SWAP arrResult[i] WITH arrResult[intMinIndex]
            APPEND current state of arrResult to arrSteps

\subsubsection*{Final Output}
Sorted list : ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "date"]
\subsection*{Discussion}
\subsubsection*{Implementation Logic}
\begin{itemize}
    \item This function applies the classic Selection Sort approach.
    \item It supports both strings and numbers by normalizing string comparisons to lowercase.
    \item It allows sorting in ascending or descending order through a Boolean flag.
    \item Steps are tracked and stored only when a swap occurs, making it suitable for educational or visualization purposes.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection*{Possible Improvements / Future Work}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Extend to support custom comparison functions (e.g., sort by length for strings).
    \item Optimize for stability (current implementation is unstable).
    \item Add time complexity tracking or step count summary.
\end{itemize}



%SEQUENTIAL SEARCH
\subsection{Sequential Search}
\subsubsection*{Brief Description}
Sequential or Linear Search is the most basic searching algorithm and is most efficient in small, unsorted arrays. It iterates every element in an array one by one until it finds the target value or reaches the last index of the array. Since it does not require the array to be sorted, linear search is simple to implement but might be inefficient to larger data sets due to its O(n) time complexity.
\subsubsection*{Pseudocode}
\begin{lstlisting}
Start

- Accept the array (arrInput) and the element (varTarget) to search for.
- Initialize variable i to 0.

- While i is less than the length of the array:
    - If the value of the element at index [i] is equal to the target element,
        - Returns the index;
        - Then end the process.
    - Else, increment i by 1.

- If the loop reaches the end of the array without finding the target element, return -1.

End
\end{lstlisting}



\subsection*{Python Implementation}
\subsubsection*{Function Code}
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
def fnLinearSearch(arrInput: list, varTarget: any) -> int:
    """
    Description:

        varTarget (any): The target element to search for

    Returns:
        int: Index of the first occurrence of varTarget if found, -1 otherwise

    """
    for intIndex in range(len(arrInput)):
        if arrInput[intIndex] == varTarget:
            return intIndex
    return -1
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection*{Simulation / Step-by-Step Example}
\subsubsection*{Sample Input}
\texttt{arrInput [6, 3, 4, 9, 7], varTarget = 4}

\subsubsection*{Step-by-Step Process}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Start with the first element (index 0), then checks if it is equal to varTarget (6 != 4)
    \item Move to the next element (index 1), then checks if it is equal to varTarget (3 != 4)
    \item Move to the next element (index 2), then checks if it is equal to varTarget (4 == 4)
    \item Since it is found, return the index 2.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{Final Output}
Output: 2

\subsection*{Discussion}
\subsubsection*{Implementation Logic}
The function uses a simple for loop to iterate every element in the array and compare it to the target value. If the current element matches the target value, the function immediately returns the index of that element. If the loop completes and iterated through each element without finding the target element, the function will return -1. With that, the loop will not have unnecessary iterations and indicate it to stop.

\subsubsection*{Possible Improvements / Future Work}
One potential improvement would be to modify the function to return all occurrences of the target value within the array instead of stopping at the first match. Additionally, allowing case-sensitive search for string values could improve its flexibility in handling written or text data. Lastly, it could be improved by better handling edge cases, such as if there's empty lists or invalid inputs.

%TRAVELING SALESMAN PROBLEM
\subsection{Traveling Salesman Problem}
\subsubsection*{Brief Description}
The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) Brute Force algorithm finds the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the starting city. It does this by recursively exploring all permutations of city visits, calculating the total distance for each path, and selecting the one with the minimum total cost. This approach guarantees an optimal solution but is computationally expensive for large numbers of cities due to its factorial time complexity.

\subsubsection*{Pseudocode}
\begin{lstlisting}
Main Function:
FUNCTION fnTSPBruteForce(distanceMatrix, startCity = 0):
    IF distanceMatrix is not a non-empty square matrix:
        RAISE error

        path = [startCity],
        allPaths,
        startCity
    ) RETURNING bestPath, minDistance

    RETURN (bestPath, minDistance, allPaths)

Recursive Helper Function:
FUNCTION fnTSPHelper(visited, currentCity, cityCount, currentDistance,
                     distanceMatrix, path, allPaths, startCity):

    IF all cities in visited are True:
        finalPath <-- path + [startCity]
        finalDistance <-- currentDistance + distance from currentCity to startCity
        APPEND (finalPath, finalDistance) to allPaths
        RETURN (finalPath, finalDistance)

    minDistance <-- infinity
    bestPath <-- empty list

    FOR each city i from 0 to cityCount - 1:
        IF visited[i] is False:
            visited[i] <-- True

            CALL fnTSPHelper(
                visited,
                currentCity = i,
                cityCount,
                currentDistance + distance from currentCity to i,
                distanceMatrix,
                path + [i],
                allPaths,
                startCity
            ) RETURNING newPath, newDistance

            IF newDistance < minDistance:
                minDistance  <--  newDistance
                bestPath  <--  newPath

    \item \texttt{startCity = 0}
    \item \texttt{distanceMatrix} =
    \[
    \begin{bmatrix}
    0 & 10 & 15 & 20 \\

    \]
\end{itemize}

This matrix defines the distances between 4 cities. For example, the distance from city 0 to city 1 is 10, and from city 2 to city 3 is 30.
\subsubsection*{Step-by-Step Process}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Initialize}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Number of cities: 4
        \item Starting city: 0
        \item \texttt{visited = [True, False, False, False]}
        \item \texttt{path = [0]}
        \item \texttt{allPaths = []}
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Recursive Exploration Begins}

    Starting from city 0, recursively explore all permutations of the remaining cities (1, 2, 3):

    \begin{itemize}
        \item 0 â†’ 1 â†’ 2 â†’ 3 â†’ 0 â†’ total distance = 10 + 35 + 30 + 20 = 95
        \item 0 â†’ 1 â†’ 3 â†’ 2 â†’ 0 â†’ total distance = 10 + 25 + 30 + 15 = 80
        \item 0 â†’ 2 â†’ 1 â†’ 3 â†’ 0 â†’ total distance = 15 + 35 + 25 + 20 = 95
        \item 0 â†’ 2 â†’ 3 â†’ 1 â†’ 0 â†’ total distance = 15 + 30 + 25 + 10 = 80
        \item 0 â†’ 3 â†’ 1 â†’ 2 â†’ 0 â†’ total distance = 20 + 25 + 35 + 15 = 95
        \item 0 â†’ 3 â†’ 2 â†’ 1 â†’ 0 â†’ total distance = 20 + 30 + 35 + 10 = 95
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Track Minimum Path}

    Among all 6 possible permutations, the algorithm identifies two paths with the lowest cost:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{[0, 1, 3, 2, 0]} â†’ 80
    \item \texttt{[0, 2, 3, 1, 0]} â†’ 80
\end{itemize}


    \item \textbf{Save All Paths}

    Each valid complete path and its total distance is stored in \texttt{allPaths}.
\end{enumerate}


\subsubsection*{Final Output}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{bestPath = [0, 1, 3, 2, 0]}
    \item \texttt{minDistance = 80}
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Note:} If there are multiple optimal paths with the same minimum cost, this implementation returns the first one it finds.


\subsection*{Discussion}
\subsubsection*{Implementation Logic}
The algorithm was implemented using recursive backtracking to exhaustively generate all permutations of cities, ensuring that each city is visited exactly once before returning to the start. This brute-force method guarantees an optimal solution by evaluating every possible tour.

\textbf{Key decisions:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Recursive design:} A helper function (\texttt{fnTSPHelper}) was used to build paths step-by-step, reducing state management complexity.
    \item \textbf{Path tracking:} Intermediate paths and distances are accumulated and stored in \texttt{allPaths} to support full visibility into all possibilities â€” useful for analysis and validation.
    \item \textbf{Validation checks:} Defensive programming techniques ensure robustness (e.g., validating that the matrix is square, the start city is valid).
    \item \textbf{Backtracking:} Cities are marked visited during recursion and unmarked after, allowing other permutations to reuse them.
\end{itemize}

This structure separates the concerns of path generation, path evaluation, and final selection, making the logic modular and easier to maintain or extend.

\subsubsection*{Possible Improvements / Future Work}
While the brute-force method guarantees correctness, it does not scale well due to its \(\mathcal{O}(n!)\) time complexity, which becomes impractical for inputs larger than ~10 cities. Potential future enhancements include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Memoization / Dynamic Programming:} \\
    Implement Held-Karp algorithm to reduce time complexity to \(\mathcal{O}(n^2 \cdot 2^n)\)

    \item \textbf{Heuristics or Approximation:} \\
    Use Greedy, Nearest Neighbor, or Genetic Algorithms for faster results on large graphs

    \item \textbf{Parallelization:} \\
    Distribute permutations across threads/cores to speed up evaluation

    \item \textbf{Visualization:} \\
    Add plotting (e.g., with matplotlib) to show tours spatially, helpful for geographic TSP instances

    \item \textbf{User Configuration:} \\
    Allow weighted constraints, asymmetric distances, or exclusion of certain cities
\end{itemize}

%KNAPSACK PROBLEM
\subsection{Knapsack Problem}
\subsubsection*{Brief Description}
The Knapsack Problem is a classic optimization problem where we need to select items with maximum value without exceeding a weight capacity. The brute force approach examines all possible combinations of items, calculating the total value and weight of each subset, and identifies the optimal solution by selecting the subset with the highest value that stays within the weight constraint.

\subsubsection*{Pseudocode}
\begin{lstlisting}
FUNCTION knapsack_brute_force(items, capacity):
    # items is a list of (name, weight, value) tuples
    # capacity is the maximum weight allowed
    bestValue = 0
    bestSubset = []
    allValidSubsets = []

    # Generate all possible combinations (2^n total)
    FOR i FROM 0 TO 2^n - 1:
        currentSubset = []
        currentWeight = 0
        currentValue = 0

        # Check which items are included in this combination
        FOR j FROM 0 TO n-1:
            IF (i & (1 << j)) > 0:  # If jth bit of i is set
                ADD items[j] TO currentSubset
                currentWeight += items[j].weight
                currentValue += items[j].value

        # If this subset is valid and better than current best
        IF currentWeight <= capacity:
            ADD (currentSubset, currentWeight, currentValue) TO allValidSubsets
            IF currentValue > bestValue:
                bestValue = currentValue
                bestSubset = currentSubset

\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Discussion}
\subsubsection*{Implementation Logic}
The implementation uses a bit manipulation technique to systematically generate all $2^n$ possible subsets of $n$ items. For each subset:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Calculate the total weight and value.
    \item Check if the subset is valid (i.e., weight $\leq$ capacity).
    \item If valid, add it to the list of valid subsets.
    \item If it has a higher value than the current best, update the best solution.
\end{itemize}

This approach guarantees finding the optimal solution since it examines every possible combination. The bit manipulation efficiently encodes which items are included in each subset, representing each subset as an integer where each bit indicates the presence or absence of an item.
\subsubsection*{Possible Improvements / Future Work}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Early termination:} Add logic to break out of loops early when certain conditions are met.
    \item \textbf{Sorting optimization:} Pre-sort items by value-to-weight ratio to potentially find better solutions earlier.
    \item \textbf{Memory optimization:} Store only necessary information for valid subsets instead of complete details.
    \item \textbf{Parallel processing:} Divide the search space among multiple processors for faster execution on large inputs.
    \item \textbf{Hybrid approach:} Combine with heuristic methods to handle larger instances more efficiently.

Given:

    &\text{} n = item\\
    &\text{} w[i] = weight \ of \ the \ item \\
    &\text{} v[i] = value \ of\  the \ item \\
    &\text{} w = knapsack \ capacity 
\end{align*}

Using the brute-force approach, we must try all the possible subsets of n. Each item has a chance to be included or excluded from the knapsack.\\

The formula to find the number of combinations:
\begin{align*}
    &\text{} = 2^n - 1\\
\end{align*}

To get the time complexity, we just need to remove the constant and get the higher order term.

\section{Optimization Techniques}
\subsection{Optimized Bubble Sort (Cocktail Shaker Sort)}
\subsubsection*{Brief Description}
Cocktail Shaker Sort is an optimized version of Bubble Sort that traverses and sort the array in both directions alternatively. It does not go through the unnecessary iteration making it efficient for large arrays. This bidirectional approach helps detect sorted portions faster.
\subsubsection*{Pseudocode}
\begin{lstlisting}
Start
    - Accept array (arrInput), boolean (boolAscending), and boolean (boolIsNumbers) to determine sorting order and data type.
        - Initialize the size of the array (intSize)
        - Initialize the variable to store the steps (listSteps)
        - Initialize intStart as 0 (starting index)
        - Initialize intEnd as intSize - 1 (last index)
        - Initialize a flag (swapped) as True to track if any swap occurred

        - If boolIsNumbers is false
              - Convert all elements in the array to string

        - If boolAscending is true
            - While boolSwapped is true

            - Set boolSwapped to false
            
                - Loop i from intStart to intEnd
                    - If element at index[i] is greater than element at index[i+1]
                        - Swap the two elements
                        - Set boolSwapped to true
                        - append a copy of listInput to listSteps
                - If boolSwapped is false then exit loop
                - Set boolSwapped to false
                - Decrease intEnd by 1

                - Loop i from intEnd - 1 to intStart (reverse order)
                    - If element at index i is greater than element at index i+1
                        - Swap the two elements
                        - Set boolSwapped to true
                        - append a copy of listInput to listSteps
                - Increase intStart by 1
        
        - else if boolAscending is false
            proceed to do the same process however instead of using index[i] is greater than index[i + 1], we will use index[i] is less than index[i + 1]. Then it will proceed to sort the list in descending order.

        Return variables listInput, listSteps

\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Discussion}
\subsubsection*{Implementation Logic}
The function accepts a list from the user along with a setting to determine whether the output should be in ascending or descending order. A checker for whether the input is an integer or letter is also added in the function. A \texttt{while} loop is used as the outer loop to keep the sorting going until the list is sorted. Inside the \texttt{while} loop, there are two \texttt{for} loops: the first is for the traditional style of bubble sort, and the second is the reverse. Reverse means the swapping starts at the end of the list and after that, it returns to the traditional style. This approach continues until a full cycle goes by without any swaps.

\subsubsection*{Possible Improvements / Future Work}
A minor improvement would be displaying the process of ascending and descending side by side automatically for comparisons and to avoid asking the user whether it should be sorted in ascending or descending order. Another simple improvement is to add a description if the swap made is from the start or from the end to make it much easier to debug and understand.

%OPT BUBBLE SORT 2
\subsection{Comb Sort (Optimized Bubble Sort)}
\subsubsection*{Brief Description}
Comb Sort is an improvement over Bubble Sort that eliminates small values near the end of the list, known as "turtles," by comparing and swapping elements at a certain gap apart. The gap starts large and shrinks by a shrink factor (commonly 1.3) each pass, allowing faster movement of elements towards their correct positions. This approach significantly improves performance over Bubble Sort, especially for larger lists, while maintaining simplicity and ease of implementation.
\subsubsection*{Pseudocode}
\begin{lstlisting}
    FUNCTION comb_sort(intArray, ascending):
    
        DEFINE gap to len(intArray) / 1.3

        WHILE gap > 0:
            SEARCH through array in range(length - gap)
                IF ascending AND array[i] > array[i + gap]:
                    SWAP array[i] and array[i + gap] 
                IF descending AND array[i] < array[i + gap]:
                    SWAP array[i] and array[i + gap]
            
            UPDATE gap = gap/1.3
            ADD array in steps

\subsection*{Discussion}
\subsubsection*{Implementation Logic}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The main logic improves Bubble Sort by introducing a gap between compared elements, allowing the algorithm to move small values ("turtles") towards the beginning more efficiently.
    
    \item The gap starts as the array length divided by a shrink factor (commonly 1.3), and is reduced in each iteration, gradually approaching a standard Bubble Sort as the gap reaches 1.
    
    \item In each pass, elements that are a "gap" apart are compared and swapped if out of order, depending on the desired sorting direction.
    
    \item This approach significantly reduces comparisons and swaps, especially for lists with small values near the end, giving better performance than Bubble Sort while staying simple and easy to understand.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection*{Possible Improvements / Future Work}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Optimize shrinking:} Implement the best shrink factor depending on the input data for improved performance.
    \item \textbf{Sort Checker:} Add functionality to allow early termination if the array is already sorted.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Bidirectional enhanced selection sort (optimized of selection sort)}
\subsubsection*{Brief Description}
The Bidirectional Enhanced Selection Sort algorithm improves upon traditional selection sort by simultaneously finding the minimum and maximum elements in each iteration, reducing the number of passes required to sort the array. It uses a bidirectional approach to sort the array from both ends, optimizing performance and minimizing redundant comparisons by moving the search base on the top of stacks. The algorithm is particularly useful for educational purposes and scenarios where simplicity and clarity are prioritized.

    This function use the advantage of applying the selection sort algorithm bidirectionally (from left to right & right to left in one iteration), swapping the previous maximum/minimum to the location before the new maximum/minimum, storing the new location of previous maximum/minimum to the stack, and once there's no new maximum/minimum, then the current maximum/minimum will be place to its correct position. To continue, the previous maximum/minimum in the stack will be use as the starting point for the next iteration and will repeat the process until the array is sorted.

\subsection*{Discussion}

\begin{itemize}
    \item This sorting algorithm enhances traditional Selection Sort by selecting both minimum and maximum values in each iteration, allowing for simultaneous sorting from both ends of the array.
    \item It efficiently moves previously identified high and low values closer to their final positions.
    \item Stacks are used to track positions of previously found minimum and maximum values, enabling the algorithm to resume correctly in the next iteration.
    \item This structure reduces redundant comparisons and improves overall performance.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection*{Possible Improvements / Future Work}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Unnecessary Swapping:} The algorithm may perform redundant swaps when elements are already in their correct positions.
    \item \textbf{Improve the Implementation:} The current implementation is complex and could be further simplified for clarity and efficiency.

%OPT SELECTION SORT
\subsection{Optimized Selection Sort}
\subsubsection*{Brief Description}
This optimized version of Selection Sort iteratively finds the minimum (or maximum) element in the unsorted portion of the list and swaps it with the first unsorted element â€” but only if a smaller (or larger) value is found. It avoids unnecessary swaps, making it more efficient in practice. It supports both numeric and case-insensitive string comparisons and maintains the original list by working on a copy.

\begin{itemize}
    \item The algorithm improves over the standard selection sort by avoiding unnecessary swaps.
    \item It works for both strings and numbers. For string comparisons, it converts elements to lowercase to ensure case-insensitive sorting.
    \item The original list is not modified; a copy is created for in-place sorting.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection*{Possible Improvements / Future Work}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Add step tracking similar to educational visualizations.
    \item Accept a custom comparison key (e.g., by string length or external ranking).
    \item Convert to a stable version by shifting instead of swapping.
\end{itemize}


%OPT LINEAR SEARCH
\subsection{Sentinel Linear Search}
\subsubsection*{Brief Description}
This  version of sequential search is called sentinel linear search, and it is optimized with minimal comparisons compared to the basic algorithm. It sets the value of the target element at the end of the array, or acting as the sentinel to ensure that the search will always find the target element without exceeding the list's bounds. This approach is slightly faster in practice because it eliminates the need for checking of boundaries. As a result, sentinel search reduces the number of comparisons, making it faster for unsorted arrays of moderate size. 

\subsubsection*{Pseudocode}
\begin{lstlisting}
Start

- Accept the array (arrArray) and the target element (intTarget).
- Initialize intLastIndex as the index of the last element in arrArray.
- Set the last element of arrArray to intTarget (sentinel).
- Initialize variable i to 0.

- While arrArray[i] is not equal to intTarget:
    - Increment i by 1.

- Restore the original last element of arrArray using intLastIndex.

- If (i is less than intLastIndex) OR (the last element of arrArray is equal to intTarget):
    - Pisplay "Element found at index [i]".
- Else, print "Element not found".

    \item Check if the element at index 0 (6) is equal to \texttt{intTarget} (6 $\neq$ 4).
    \item Check if the element at index 1 (3) is equal to \texttt{intTarget} (3 $\neq$ 4).
    \item Check if the element at index 2 (4) is equal to \texttt{intTarget} (4 == 4). The target is found at index 2.
    \item Restore the original last element (7) using the stored index.
    \item \texttt{arrArray} returns to [6, 3, 4, 9, 7].
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{Final Output}
Output: Element found at index 2.
\subsection*{Discussion}
\subsubsection*{Implementation Logic}
The function uses a sentinel value to optimize the traditional linear search, thus calling it a \textit{sentinel linear search}. It first replaces the last element of the array with the target value; with this, the search always finds the target without exceeding the array bounds. It then iterates through the array from the first index and compares each element to the target element. When the target value is found, the function prints the result with the index. After the search, it restores the original last index value. The sentinel linear search eliminates a separate boundary check during each comparison while also reducing unnecessary operations.
\subsubsection*{Possible Improvements / Future Work}    
Like the normal linear search, the sentinel linear search scans each element of the array to find a target value. It improves the process by temporarily placing the target value at the end of the array to ensure the search ends within bounds. While this approach is already an improvement, it could be further enhanced. For example:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Instead of stopping at the first match, it could collect all matching indices or occurrencesâ€”especially useful for arrays with duplicate values.
    \item It could allow case-sensitive searches for text values.
    \item It should properly handle special cases, such as empty arrays or non-comparable elements.
\end{itemize}




%SELF ORGANIZING
\subsection{Self Organizing List (Optimized Sequential Search)}
\subsubsection*{Brief Description}
A self-organizing list is a data structure that reorders its elements based on access frequency, moving frequently accessed items closer to the front to improve search efficiency. Each time an element is searched, its access count is increased, and the list is reorganized so that elements with higher frequencies appear earlier. This adaptive approach optimizes sequential search performance, especially when certain elements are accessed more often than others.

\subsection*{Discussion}
\subsubsection*{Implementation Logic}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The main logic of the self-organizing list implementation is to improve sequential search efficiency by dynamically reordering the list based on search frequency.
    \item Each element in the list is paired with a frequency counter, which is incremented every time the element is searched.
    \item After each search, the element is moved forward in the list until it is ahead of all elements with lower or equal frequency.
    \item This adaptive approach reduces the average search time for commonly accessed elements, making the structure more efficient for non-uniform access patterns.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection*{Possible Improvements / Future Work}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Optimize reordering process:} When every element has the same frequency, unnecessary swaps may occur.

%OPT DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING FOR KNAPSACK
\subsection{Dynamic Programming (optimized of Knapsack Problem)}
\subsubsection*{Brief Description}
The Dynamic Programming Knapsack algorithm efficiently solves the 0/1 Knapsack Problem by building a table that records the maximum value achievable for every possible number of items and capacity. It systematically considers each item and determines whether including it yields a better value than excluding it, filling out the table based on these choices. This approach guarantees an optimal solution and allows for easy reconstruction of the selected items that make up the maximum value.

\subsubsection*{Implementation Logic}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The main logic of the dynamic programming knapsack implementation is to build a 2D table where each entry represents the maximum value achievable with a given number of items and a specific capacity.
    \item For each item and each possible capacity, the algorithm decides whether to include the current item by comparing the value of including it (if it fits) versus excluding it, and stores the maximum of these two options in the table.
    \item After filling the table, the algorithm traces back from the bottom-right cell to determine which items were included in the optimal solution by checking where the value changes, reconstructing the list of selected items.
    \item This approach ensures that all subproblems are solved and combined efficiently, guaranteeing an optimal solution for the 0/1 Knapsack Problem.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Possible Improvements / Future Work} 
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Input Flexibility:} Allow the function to handle fractional weights/values for solving the fractional knapsack problem.
    \item \textbf{Early Termination:} Add checks to terminate early if the optimal solution is found before filling the entire table.

\subsubsection*{Sample Input}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{startCity = 0}
    \item \texttt{distanceMatrix} =
    \[
    \begin{bmatrix}
    0 & 10 & 15 & 20 \\

    \]
\end{itemize}

This matrix defines the distances between 4 cities. For example, the distance from city 0 to city 1 is 10, and from city 2 to city 3 is 30.
\subsubsection*{Step-by-Step Process}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Initialize}
    
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \texttt{cityCount = 4}
        \item \texttt{totalMasks = 2\textasciicircum4 = 16}
        \item \texttt{dpCost} and \texttt{dpPrev} are initialized:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item \texttt{dpCost[1 << 0][0] = 0} \quad (i.e., \texttt{dpCost[0001][0] = 0})
                \item All other entries are set to $\infty$ or \texttt{None}
            \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Dynamic Programming Loop}

    Iteratively build minimal costs to reach each subset of visited cities ending at a specific city.

    \begin{itemize}
        \item \texttt{mask = 0011} (cities 0 and 1 visited)
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Consider transition from 0 $\rightarrow$ 1
                \item \texttt{dpCost[0011][1] = dpCost[0001][0] + distance[0][1] = 0 + 10 = 10}

            \begin{itemize}
                \item Consider ending at city 2 from city 1:
                \item \texttt{dpCost[0111][2] = dpCost[0011][1] + distance[1][2] = 10 + 35 = 45}
            \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}

    This continues until all possible combinations of visited cities are filled in the table.

    \item \textbf{Find Minimum Cost Tour}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \texttt{finalMask = 1111} (all cities visited)
        \item For each city $i \ne$ \texttt{startCity}, compute: \texttt{dpCost[1111][i] + distance[i][0]}
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Reconstruct Path}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Start from \texttt{lastCity} determined above
        \item Walk backward using \texttt{dpPrev} to reconstruct the full path
        \item Insert each city at position 1 in the path, ending with \texttt{startCity} at both ends
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
\subsubsection*{Final Output}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{bestPath = [0, 1, 3, 2, 0]}
    \item \texttt{minDistance = 80}
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Discussion}
\subsubsection*{Implementation Logic}
This algorithm uses dynamic programming with bitmasking (Held-Karp) to efficiently solve the TSP. Instead of exploring every possible permutation recursively, it builds up solutions incrementally by computing the shortest path to reach every subset of cities with a known ending point. The key innovation is using a bitmask to represent visited cities, enabling memoization of overlapping subproblems.

Key decisions include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{DP Table (\texttt{dpCost})}: Stores the minimum cost to reach a subset of cities ending at a specific city.
    \item \textbf{Bitmasking}: Efficiently tracks subsets using integer masks (e.g., \texttt{01101} means cities 0, 2, and 3 are visited).
    \item \textbf{Backtracking (\texttt{dpPrev})}: Enables full path reconstruction after computing the minimum cost.
    \item \textbf{Start-City Optimization}: Skips any state not containing the start city to reduce unnecessary computations.
\end{itemize}

This design keeps the time and space complexity at $\mathcal{O}(n^2 \cdot 2^n)$ and allows solutions for up to $\sim$20 cities on modern machines.


\subsubsection*{Possible Improvements / Future Work}    
Despite being much faster than brute-force, this approach has limitations:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Space Optimization:} Use a rolling array for \texttt{dpCost} to reduce space from $\mathcal{O}(n \cdot 2^n)$ to $\mathcal{O}(2 \cdot n \cdot 2^n)$.
    \item \textbf{Parallelism:} Parallelize independent subset evaluations to improve performance.
    \item \textbf{Early Exit Strategies:} Prune subtrees using lower-bound heuristics (like in branch-and-bound).
    \item \textbf{Graph Visualization:} Add support to visualize tours using a plotting library for better interpretation.
    \item \textbf{Path Caching:} Cache frequent sub-paths for TSP instances with repeated structures (meta-heuristics).
\end{itemize}



%OPT BRANCH AND BOUND
\subsection{Branch and Bound (optimized of Travelling Salesman Problem)}
\subsubsection*{Brief Description}
The Branch and Bound algorithm for the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) systematically explores all possible routes using a state-space tree, but prunes branches that cannot yield a better solution than the best one found so far. By maintaining lower bounds on the cost of partial solutions and expanding only the most promising nodes, it efficiently narrows down the search space to find the minimum-cost tour. This approach is particularly effective for solving combinatorial optimization problems like TSP where exhaustive search is impractical for larger instances.

        \item a partial path,
        \item a reduced cost matrix,
        \item the accumulated cost so far,
        \item the current city, and
        \item the level (number of cities visited).
    \end{itemize}
    \item At each step, the algorithm selects the node with the lowest estimated cost (using a priority queue), expands it by considering all possible next cities, and updates the cost matrix and lower bound using row and column reductions.
    \item When a complete tour is found (all cities visited), the total cost is compared to the current minimum, and the best path is updated if a lower cost is found.
    \item This approach efficiently narrows the search space by prioritizing promising paths and discarding those that cannot improve the solution, making it suitable for solving TSP instances where exhaustive search is impractical.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection*{Possible Improvements / Future Work}    
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Implementation Complexity:} Improve the implementation for better readability, maintainability, and ease of debugging.
    \item \textbf{Optimize Node Expansion and Pruning:} Further reduce the number of unnecessary branches explored.

\section{Findings and Conclusion}
\hspace{.2in}Throughout this exploration of brute force algorithmsâ€”Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Sequential Search, Traveling Salesman Problem, and Knapsack Problemâ€”we've gained significant practical understanding of computer science's most fundamental problem-solving approaches. These straightforward techniques form the backbone of algorithmic thinking and provide essential context for more sophisticated methods.

Our implementations revealed that while brute force approaches guarantee correct solutions by exhaustively checking all possibilities, they come with serious performance limitations. The sorting algorithms (Bubble and Selection Sort) demonstrated $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ time complexity, making them impractical for large datasets despite their conceptual simplicity. Similarly, the combinatorial explosion in the Traveling Salesman Problem ($\mathcal{O}(n!)$) and Knapsack Problem ($\mathcal{O}(2^n)$) highlighted why computational efficiency becomes critical in real-world applications.

The optimization techniques we developedâ€”like Cocktail Shaker Sort, Comb Sort, and Bidirectional Enhanced Selection Sort for the simpler algorithms, and Dynamic Programming and Branch-and-Bound approaches for the complex problemsâ€”showed how clever modifications can dramatically improve performance without sacrificing accuracy. These optimizations reduced redundant operations and unnecessary comparisons while maintaining the core logic of the original algorithms.

Perhaps most importantly, this work underscored why understanding brute force methods matters: they establish baseline performance metrics against which all other algorithms are measured. By implementing both the basic and optimized versions, we gained hands-on experience with the fundamental trade-offs between time complexity, space requirements, and implementation difficulty that drive algorithm design.

The self-organizing search list implementation particularly demonstrated how adding adaptive behavior can improve performance for real-world usage patterns where data access isn't uniformly random. This principleâ€”adapting algorithms to match real-world constraints and patternsâ€”represents one of the most powerful lessons from our work.

Learning to analyze algorithms mathematically through time complexity calculations also proved essential. The stark difference between polynomial-time algorithms like Bubble Sort ($\mathcal{O}(n^2)$) and exponential ones like brute force Knapsack ($\mathcal{O}(2^n)$) became clear not just in theory but in our practical implementations.

The progression from brute force to optimized algorithms mirrored the historical development of computer science itselfâ€”starting with straightforward but inefficient approaches before refining them through careful analysis and creative problem-solving. This journey from simplicity to sophistication isn't just academic; it's the same path we'll follow when tackling new computational problems.

Working through these implementations has strengthened our programming skills, deepened our understanding of algorithm analysis, and prepared us to recognize when brute force approaches are appropriate and when more sophisticated techniques are needed. Though brute force algorithms may seem obsolete in an era of highly optimized libraries, they remain the foundation upon which all algorithmic thinking is builtâ€”and mastering them is the first step toward computational excellence.
