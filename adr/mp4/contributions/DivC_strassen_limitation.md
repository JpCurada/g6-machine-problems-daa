**5.8 Strassen's Algorithm Limitations**

1. Memory Overhead
Requires significant additional memory for storing intermediate matrices (M1-M7) and submatrices, 
making it memory-intensive compared to standard multiplication.

2. Numerical Stability Issues
The multiple additions and subtractions can accumulate floating-point errors, potentially leading 
to less accurate results than traditional matrix multiplication, especially with large matrices.

3. Limited Practical Advantage for Small Matrices
Only becomes efficient for very large matrices. For smaller matrices, the 
recursive overhead and complexity often make it slower than the standard O(nÂ³) approach.

4. Implementation Complexity
Significantly more complex to implement and debug than standard matrix multiplication, requiring careful 
handling of matrix padding, submatrix extraction, and recursive calls, which increases development time and 
potential for errors.
